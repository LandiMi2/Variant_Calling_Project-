Variant Calling Step by step 

Before any analysis you need to have data already prepared for your analysis. For this work you have read 1 and read 2(for this expt 
they did a paired end illumina sequencing) of WES datasets for chromosome one 
of Homo sapiens species 

Phase 1 Analysis 
- Check quality of reads using fastqc 
$fastqc read1fq.gz read2.fq.gz 
- do a multqc in the folder that has results from fastqc 
$multqc. <enter> #this will create a multiqc.html file for you to check quality of your reads 

if your reads look good and you happy to proceed I am happy to carry on...

Now you have your good quality reads but again you might want to check if you have have short reads and unpaired reads that my not align where you want 
especially when you doing your alignment. Use Trimmomatic for this annalysis 

$trimmomatic PE -phred33 WES_chr1_50X_E0.005_merged_read1.fq.gz WES_chr1_50X_E0.005_merged_read2.fq.gz WES_chr1_read1_output_paired.fq.gz WES_chr1_read1_output_unpaired.fq.gz WES_chr1_read2_output_paired.fq.gz WES_chr1_read2_output_unpaired.fq.gz ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10:2:keepBothReads LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 MINLEN:36

Next you want to do an alignment of the reads to the reference genome (for this expt we used the whole genome of Homo sapeins species) 

$wget ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/hg38/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta #download your reference file 

$bwa index -a bwtsw Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta #added bwtsw because you are using a whole genome reference sequence 
$ bwa mem –t 2 reference read_1 read_2 > BWA.sam #do your read alignment, value 2 is optional depending on how many cores you have 

Now you have a sam file, generate a binary file (bam) 

$samtools view -Sb BWA.sam | samtools sort - > Homo_sapeins_BWA.bam  #generate a bam file
$samtools index Homo_sapeins_BWA.bam  #index you bam
$samtools flagstat Homo_sapeins_BWA.bam #get the stats for your alignment 

Removal of deduplication using sambamba tool 
$sambamba markdup -r Homo_sapiens_BWA.bam Homo_sapiens_BWA_Clean.bam
$samtools index Homo_sapiens_BWA_Clean.bam #index your cleaned bam file 




Phase 2 
Now you have your clean bam file without  duplications the preceeinding steps you will use gatk toolkit (for this expt gatk4 is used for analysis).
First is to come up with a recalibration report and to do this you need to prepare your input files 
For your reference :
$samtools faidx Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta #this will help you create a fasta.fai 
$gatk CreateSequenceDictionary -R Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta -O Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dict #you want to create a reference dictionary

Note that for this step you need to download three known sites vcf files and prepare them in finding indexfuturefiles for this file 

$wget ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/hg38/beta/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf.gz
$wget ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/hg38/Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf.gz
$wget ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/hg38/beta/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.known_indels.vcf.gz

unzip and prepare the three files 
$gatk IndexFeatureFile -F Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf
$gatk IndexFeatureFile -F Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf
$gatk IndexFeatureFile -F Homo_sapiens_assembly38.known_indels.vcf

also you clean bam file migth have some issues with its read groups , sorting this 
$gatk AddOrReplaceReadGroups -I Homo_sapiens_BWA_Clean.bam -O Homo_sapiens_BWA_readgroups.bam -ID 4 -LB lib1 -PL illumina -PU unit1 -SM 20

Now you ready to do you recalibration!!!

$gatk BaseRecalibrator -R Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta -I Homo_sapiens_BWA_readgroups.bam -O Homo_sapiens_Recalibrator_report.grp --known-sites Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf --known-sites Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf --known-sites Homo_sapiens_assembly38.known_indels.vcf

Don't be too much excited coz you did the step hehe ....you now have a recalibration report, you need to use that to create a recalibrated bam file 
$gatk ApplyBQSR -bqsr Homo_sapiens_Recalibrator_report.grp -I Homo_sapiens_BWA_readgroups.bam -O Home_sapiens_recalibrated.bam


Awesome!!! you almost there buddy 
The last shot is to create your variant file
$gatk HaplotypeCaller -I Home_sapiens_recalibrated.bam -O Homo_sapiens_variant.vcf -R Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta

Boom !!! you have your vcf file now ...you might want to view you file in VEP database and view your results 

Note that this analysis we majored on required options , you might want to add other optional arguments rather parameters for your analysis.
Happy Finding Variants!!! TADA!!!
