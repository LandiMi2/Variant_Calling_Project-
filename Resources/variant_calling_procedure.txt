Variant Calling Step by Step 

Before any analysis, you need to have data already prepared for your study. For this work, you have read 1 and read 2 of WES datasets for chromosome one 
of Homo sapiens species 

Phase 1 Analysis 
- Check the quality of reads using fastqc 
$fastqc read1fq.gz read2.fq.gz 
- do a multqc in the folder that has resulted from fastqc 
$multqc. <enter> #this will create a multiqc.html file for you to check the quality of your reads 

If your reads look good and you happy to proceed, I am delighted to carry on...

Now you have your good quality reads, but again you might want to check if you have short reads and unpaired reads that may not align where you want, especially when you doing your alignment. Use Trimmomatic for this analysis 

$trimmomatic PE -phred33 WES_chr1_50X_E0.005_merged_read1.fq.gz WES_chr1_50X_E0.005_merged_read2.fq.gz WES_chr1_read1_output_paired.fq.gz WES_chr1_read1_output_unpaired.fq.gz WES_chr1_read2_output_paired.fq.gz WES_chr1_read2_output_unpaired.fq.gz ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10:2:keepBothReads LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 MINLEN:36

Next, you want to do an alignment of the reads to the reference genome (for this expt we used the whole genome of Homo sapiens species) 

$wget ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/hg38/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta #download your reference file 

$bwa index -a bwtsw Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta #added bwtsw because you are using a whole-genome reference sequence 
$ bwa mem â€“t 2 reference read_1 read_2 > BWA.sam #do your read alignment, value 2 is optional depending on how many cores you have 

Now you have a sam file, generate a binary file (bam) 

$samtools view -Sb BWA.sam | samtools sort - > Homo_sapeins_BWA.bam  #generate a bam file
$samtools index Homo_sapeins_BWA.bam  #index you bam
$samtools flagstat Homo_sapeins_BWA.bam #get the stats for your alignment 

Removal of deduplication using sambamba tool 
$sambamba markdup -r Homo_sapiens_BWA.bam Homo_sapiens_BWA_Clean.bam
$samtools index Homo_sapiens_BWA_Clean.bam #index your cleaned bam file 




Phase 2 
Now you have your clean bam file without duplications the proceeding steps you will use gatk toolkit (for this expt gatk4 is used for analysis).
First is to come up with a recalibration report and to do this you need to prepare your input files 
For your reference :
$samtools faidx Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta #this will help you create a fasta.fai 
$gatk CreateSequenceDictionary -R Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta -O Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dict #you want to create a reference dictionary

Note that for this Step you need to download three known sites vcf files and prepare them in finding indexfuturefiles for this file. 

$wget ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/hg38/beta/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf.gz
$wget ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/hg38/Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf.gz
$wget ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/hg38/beta/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.known_indels.vcf.gz

unzip and prepare the three files 
$gatk IndexFeatureFile -F Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf
$gatk IndexFeatureFile -F Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf
$gatk IndexFeatureFile -F Homo_sapiens_assembly38.known_indels.vcf

also you clean bam file might have some issues with its read groups, sorting this 
$gatk AddOrReplaceReadGroups -I Homo_sapiens_BWA_Clean.bam -O Homo_sapiens_BWA_readgroups.bam -ID 4 -LB lib1 -PL illumina -PU unit1 -SM 20

Now you ready to do you recalibration!!!

$gatk BaseRecalibrator -R Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta -I Homo_sapiens_BWA_readgroups.bam -O Homo_sapiens_Recalibrator_report.grp --known-sites Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf --known-sites Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf --known-sites Homo_sapiens_assembly38.known_indels.vcf

Don't be too much-excited because you did the Step; you now have a recalibration report, you need to use that to create a recalibrated bam file 
$gatk ApplyBQSR -bqsr Homo_sapiens_Recalibrator_report.grp -I Homo_sapiens_BWA_readgroups.bam -O Home_sapiens_recalibrated.bam


Awesome!!! you almost there buddy 
The last shot is to create your variant file
$gatk HaplotypeCaller -I Home_sapiens_recalibrated.bam -O Homo_sapiens_variant.vcf -R Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta

Boom !!! you have your vcf file now, you might want to view your file in VEP database and view your results and filter out specific preferred variants. 

Note that this analysis we majored on required options, you might want to add other optional arguments rather parameters for your study.


Happy Finding Variants!!! TADA!!!
